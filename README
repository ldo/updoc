What’s Updoc?
=============

**Updoc** is a tool for managing snapshots of collections of files.
Files may be saved into a snapshot and restored from a snapshot. Snapshots
are saved in an SQLite database. Selection of files may be done by
attaching filter rules to the database, or by explicitly specifying file
names on the command line. The base directory for save/restore operations
is specified as part of the command; thus a snapshot may be saved from
one directory and restored to a different directory.

See the enclosed updoc(1) man page for more details.
